# There are four base abstracts
#   byte
#   number
#   list
#   map
#   void

# Abstracts have a "poperties" property (lol),
#   a map matching property names to other abstracts
# The base abstracts have "properties" empty

# abstracts will have a "properties" property
# each property should be another abstract
